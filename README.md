# Named_Entity_Recognition
Built with Flask, Python, HTML, and CSS, our NER Web App simplifies text analysis. Users input text, triggering a Python NER engine (spaCy or NLTK), highlighting and categorizing entities. The user-friendly interface offers customization options, entity details, and export features, providing a powerful tool for efficient named entity recognition.
